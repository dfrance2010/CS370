**Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?**

For this project, I designed an intelligent agent to solve a maze. This involved implementing a deep-Q learning algorithm, using a neural network to calculate the best available move at any given square. Much of the code, including the neural network and game, were already set up. I programmed my agent to explore the maze in the early stages of training, then exploit that knowledge in later stages. The results were stored and when the agent reached a 100% win rate, the training ended.

**What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?**

Computer scientists take real-world problems and solve them using software engineering. It matters because much of our daily lives relies on programs that have been developed by computer scientists, including high-importance systems such as flight control, medical equipment, and financial applications. If these systems fail, it could have catastrophic consequences for individuals.

**How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?**

I collect requirements, develop a solution on paper, code the solution, test, refactor, test, and review the requirements before declaring a project done. I think the first two steps – collecting requirements and developing a solution – are by far the most important, as they set the tone for the rest of the project.

**What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?**

Put simply, it is always important to consider the end user and how an application will be utilized. In terms of AI and machine learning, this means being cognizant of biases in training data and techniques. It also means constant vigilance after deployment to fix ethical concerns that slipped through the development stage. While all programs are tools, and tools can be used for good or bad out in the real world, we as computer scientists shouldn’t knowingly build something that will be used to harm another human being.
